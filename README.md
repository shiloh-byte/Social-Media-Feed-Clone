# Social-Media-Feed-Clone
Project that mimics the scrollable feed for social media. Using HTML, CSS, API's, and vanilla JavaScript.


The most difficult thing I encountered while making this project was trying to throttle the scroll event
to keep from firing off after every px scrolled.

I may add on to this in the future.
